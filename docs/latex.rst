LaTeX Guide
===========

Latex had multiple distributions such as MikTex and TexLive. We will use MikTex as our distribution.

Installing MikTex on Windows
----------------------------

1. Go to the MikTex website: https://miktex.org/download
2. Click on the "Download" button for Windows.
3. Choose the default "install on the fly" option during installation.

Latex has many packages. We will not install all the packages. If a package is required later, MikTex will ask permission to install it.
