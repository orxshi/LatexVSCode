Preparing LaTeX
===========

LaTeX has multiple distributions such as MikTeX and TeX Live. We will use MikTeX.

Installing MikTeX on Windows
----------------------------

1. Go to the MikTeX website: https://miktex.org/download
2. Click on the "Download" button for Windows.
3. Choose the default "install on the fly" option during installation.

LaTeX has many packages but we will not install all of them. If a package is required later, MikTeX will ask permission to install it.

Adding LaTeX Workshop Extension to VS Code
------------------------------------------

Search for "latex" in the VS Code extensions marketplace. Install the *LaTeX Workshop* extension by James Yu.
